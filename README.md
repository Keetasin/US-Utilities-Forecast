# US Utilities Sector Stock Forecasting

## Description
This project is an all-in-one web application for stock analysis and forecasting. It features an interactive dashboard that allows users to view stock details, historical price trends, key financial indicators, and more in real time. The system supports multiple forecasting models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, and LSTM, along with a backtesting feature that evaluates model accuracy using MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as the performance metric.

The application can forecast stock prices over 1 week, 6 months, and 1 year, and enables model comparison to identify the best-performing approach. It also provides the 5 latest relevant news articles. Integrated with Airflow, the system trains models and automatically updates data from Monday to Friday, storing all information in PostgreSQL. This platform empowers users to analyze trends, assess model accuracy, and make strategic, data-driven decisions effectively.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
